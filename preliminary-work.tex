\chapter{Preliminary work}
	\label{sec:preliminary-work}
	
	% General feeling has been learning about SpiNNaker's network, in particular
	% looking at how the original async interconnect and routing behaves with
	% Mohsen, focusing in on the high speed serial links and the constraints and
	% features they offer.
	
	\section{SpiNNaker network modelling}
		
		% Colaboration with others researching simulator platforms, due for journal
		% submission in coming months, final stages of writing. Context of the work:
		% want to try out modelling on different platforms. My contribution: some
		% writing and the development of an accurate software simulator for
		% SpiNNaker's interconnect. This work indirectly offers interesting insights
		% into behaviours due to the board-to-board links.
		
		\subsection{Software simulator model}
			
			% Model 18 cores as traffic generators/consumers. Links are modelled as
			% delay elements (accurately captures req/ack links), internal arbitration
			% scheme is modelled along with pipelined router.
		
		\subsection{Results}
			
			% Experiments performed showed highly matched behaviour between the model
			% and SpiNNaker but reveal the effects of the non-homogeneity introduced
			% by board-to-board links for certain traffic patterns.
		
		\subsection{Further work}
			
			% Plans to include models of SpiNNaker links. Preliminary trials at
			% accurately modelling these have been unsuccessful. Will be used to guide
			% work on these links.
	
	\section{SpiNNaker machine wiring}
		
		% Constraint of electrical high-speed-serial is that long wires are not
		% allowed. For tori, this is a problem due to wrap-around.
		
		\subsection{Reducing wiring length}
			
			% Description of the folding technique
		
		\subsection{`SpiNNer' Wiring Guide Generator}
			
			% Python Library and various front-ends have been produced which produce
			% wiring diagrams and listings. The tool has been successfuly used to
			% assemble machines (pictures!) and provide orders for cabling for the
			% next machines.
	
	
	\section{Small-world networks}
		
		% Small world networks are: ... Allow lots of short paths, this means low
		% latency, low power and less contention. We describe ways of augmenting the
		% SpiNNaker network, making use of spare connections and resource for
		% board-to-board links while taking advantage of the physical arrangement
		% described in the previous section.
		
		\subsection{Constructing small-world networks}
			
			% Add random links and lo-and-behold, smallworldness!
		
		\subsection{Modelling and results}
			
			% Don't need too many links to get a good return in terms of reduced
			% path length. Limiting results to short wires doesn't hurt too much,
			% especially after folding.
		
		\subsection{Further work}
			
			% Non-uniformity to be studied. Also, plan to model this with more
			% realistic traffic and experiment on SpiNNaker.
	
	
	\section{SpiNNaker FPGA connectivity}
		
		% Work started at CapoCaccia with input from various parties to get
		% SpiNNaker peripherals working. The start of a project to get peripherals
		% properly integrated and generally add some routing smarts to the FPGAs
			
			\subsection{Existing infrastructure}
				
				% Description of what exists already in the board-to-board links,
				% outline the protocol's principles. Also describe the rdy/vld
				% interface.
			
			\subsection{Extension peripherals}
				
				% Describe principle of how a router will be integrated and streams
				% merged.
			
			\subsection{Proof-of-concept `spiking button' peripheral}
				
				% Describe the demo and hardware used
				
				\subsubsection{Handling multiple link speeds}
					
					% Streams of packets being produced at different speeds due to slower
					% peripheral FPGA board. Describe the interface's role, outline the
					% mechanism and avoidance of buffering.
				
				\subsubsection{Merging packet streams}
					
					% Again, describe the problem, and the challenges of doing this
					% without losing throughput.
			
			\subsection{Further work}
				
				% Next steps will involve getting basic routing up and running, then on
				% to my planned project, see next chapter.
