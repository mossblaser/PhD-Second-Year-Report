	\begin{abstract}
		
		Many attempts to understand the vast complexity of the brain centre on
		simulating models of its behaviour. Conventional super-computers have failed
		to provide the necessary power to execute large-scale models of the brain's
		function leading to the development of special purpose `neuromorphic'
		hardware.
		
		This project aims to advance the way in which high-speed serial (HSS)
		technology is used in neural simulation systems. The SpiNNaker neural
		simulator features extensive use of HSS links in its interconnect and is
		used as both a platform and a case-study for this work. Preliminary work has
		yielded a novel extension to SpiNNaker's network which exploits the complex
		wiring schemes used in its construction.  Upcoming work is intended to
		implement these extensions within the actual SpiNNaker hardware as well as
		incorporating complementary power management schemes.
